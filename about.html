<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Guruprasath! I recently graduated with a degree in Computer and Communication Engineering from Sairam Institute of Technology. I’m someone who loves exploring the world of technology and finding creative ways to apply it to real-life problems. During my college years, I worked on Eaglite, a CanSat project where we used IoT and machine learning to collect and analyze atmospheric data—a project that really fueled my interest in innovation and hands-on problem solving.

  Beyond tech, I’m a music lover and a big fan of cricket—both of which help me unwind and stay balanced. I'm also deeply motivated by the idea of building something of my own. In the next few years, I see myself stepping into entrepreneurship, launching a venture that not only grows but also gives back to the community in meaningful ways.
  
  Thanks for stopping by—I’m excited to share my journey with you!
